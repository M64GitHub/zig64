A **Commodore 64 MOS 6510 emulator core** implemented in **Zig**, designed for precision, flexibility, and seamless integration into C64-focused projects. This emulator delivers cycle-accurate execution, detailed raster beam emulation for PAL and NTSC video synchronization, and SID register tracking, making it a robust foundation for C64 software analysis, execution, and development.

Built as the **computational backbone** of a virtual C64 system, it supports a variety of applications‚Äîfrom analyzing and debugging C64 programs to serving as the engine for SID sound emulation libraries like üéß [zigreSID](https://github.com/M64GitHub/zigreSID).  
Leveraging Zig‚Äôs modern features, it provides a clean and extensible platform for accurately emulating C64 behavior.

This project **began with a love for Commodore 64 SID music** and a desire to recreate and enhance that experience across platforms. As a musician using the C64, I aimed to tweak and modify SID tunes, which required working with `.sid` files‚Äîarchives that embed 6510 CPU assembly code for player routines. To unlock this potential, I needed a CPU emulator to execute these routines, analyze how they manipulate SID registers over time, and build custom tools for sound experimentation, laying the groundwork for this emulator core.

**A goal** of this project is to **lower the barriers** to C64 emulation, providing an accessible entry point for developers and enthusiasts alike. With its straightforward design and Zig‚Äôs intuitive tooling, tasks like debugging intricate C64 programs, tracing execution paths, or testing software behavior are made approachable, empowering users to explore and experiment with minimal setup or complexity.

## Overview

The `C64` struct orchestrates a modular virtual C64 system, integrating `Cpu` for instruction execution, `Ram64k` for memory, `Vic` for video timing, and `Sid` as a (for now) register placeholder. Each component includes its own `dbg_enabled` flag‚Äîe.g., `c64.dbg_enabled` for emulator logs, `cpu.dbg_enabled` for execution details‚Äîallowing tailored debugging. The `Cpu` drives the system, executing code and monitoring SID register writes, while `Vic` keeps cycle-accurate timing.  
A powerful disassembler struct `Insn`, enriches this core, decoding instructions with detailed metadata for advanced analysis. The sections below detail their workings, API, and examples to help you use this emulator core effectively.




### C64
The main emulator struct, combining CPU, memory, VIC, and SID for a complete C64 system.

- **Fields**:
  - `cpu: Cpu` - The 6510 CPU instance.
  - `mem: Ram64k` - 64KB memory.
  - `vic: Vic` - Video timing component.
  - `sid: Sid` - SID register tracker.
  - `dbg_enabled: bool` - Enables debug logging across components.

- **Functions**:
  - `pub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, vic_model: Vic.Model, init_addr: u16) C64` - Initializes a new C64 instance with default settings.
  - `pub fn deinit(c64: *C64, allocator: std.mem.Allocator) void` - Cleanup the C64 instance.
  - `loadPrg(c64: *C64,
    allocator: std.mem.Allocator,
    file_name: []const u8,
    pc_to_loadaddr: bool,
) !u16` - Loads a `.prg` file into memory returns the load address.
  - `run() !void` - Executes the CPU until program end.
  - `call(c64: *C64, address: u16) void` - calls an assembly subroutine, returns on RTS.

## Using zig64 In Your Project
To add `zig64` as a dependency, use:
```sh
zig fetch --save https://github.com/M64GitHub/zig64/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.0-alpha.tar.gz
```
This will add the dependency to your `build.zig.zon`:
```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .zig64 = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/M64GitHub/zig64/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.0-alpha.tar.gz",
        .hash = "zig64-0.2.0-v6FneuiXAwDZ6n7QNBVykEJsMxkbIyfHTNqdjy_ZZ_3l",
    },
},
```

In your `build.zig`, add the module as follows:
```zig
pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
    const target = b.standardTargetOptions(.{});
    const optimize = std.builtin.OptimizeMode.ReleaseFast;

    const dep_zig64 = b.dependency("zig64", .{}); // define the dependeny
    const mod_zig64 = dep_zig64.module("zig64");  // define the module

    // ...

    // add to an example executable:
    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "loadPrg-example",
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/examples/loadprg_example.zig"),
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });
    exe.root_module.addImport("zig64", mod_zig64); // add the module

    // ...
}
```
